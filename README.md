# Conceptual Short-Answer Questions and Reference Answers with Corresponding Entropy

This document contains the possible reference answers and their corresponding entropy values for four conceptual short-answer questions used in our study. Each table represents a different question, detailing the content of each reference answer and its calculated entropy value.

## Question 1: Possible Reference Answers and Corresponding Entropy

| Answer | Content                                                                                                                  | Entropy |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1      | The ring has a greater moment of inertia because the mass of the ring is further from the axis of rotation.              | 3.6897  |
| 2      | The ring has a greater moment of inertia because the mass of the ring is further from the axis of rotation. In this case, the moment of inertia of the ring is twice that of the disc. | 3.9685  |
| 3      | The ring has a greater moment of inertia because the mass of the ring is further from the axis of rotation. In this case, the moment of inertia of the ring is \(mR^2\), while that of the disc is \(0.5mR^2\). | 4.1052  |

## Question 2: Possible Reference Answers and Corresponding Entropy

| Answer | Content                                                                                                                  | Entropy |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1      | The ring has a greater moment of inertia because the mass of the ring is further from the axis of rotation.              | 3.6897  |
| 2      | The ring has a greater moment of inertia because the mass of the ring is further from the axis of rotation. In this case, the moment of inertia of the ring is four-thirds that of the disc. | 3.9685  |
| 3      | The ring has a greater moment of inertia because the mass of the ring is further from the axis of rotation. In this case, the distance moved by the axis is the same. According to the parallel axis theorem, their change in moment of inertia compared to when the axis passes through the center is the same, but when the axis passes through the center, the moment of inertia of the ring is greater. | 4.6150  |

## Question 3: Possible Reference Answers and Corresponding Entropy

| Answer | Content                                                                                                                  | Entropy |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1      | The raw egg stops first because there is friction between the egg liquid inside the raw egg and the eggshell.             | 3.5842  |
| 2      | The raw egg stops first because under the action of centrifugal force, the egg liquid in the raw egg moves outward, causing the moment of inertia to increase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the angular velocity of rotation decreases. | 4.4208  |
| 3      | The raw egg stops first, on one hand, because under the action of centrifugal force, the egg liquid in the raw egg moves outward, causing the moment of inertia to increase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the angular velocity of rotation decreases. On the other hand, there is friction between the egg liquid and the eggshell, causing it to lose mechanical energy more quickly. | 5.0448  |

## Question 4: Possible Reference Answers and Corresponding Entropy

| Answer | Content                                                                                                                  | Entropy |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1      | When the relative speed between the boat and the person is constant, the smaller the mass of the boat, the greater the speed at which it leaves the riverbank, and the harder it is for the person to jump ashore. | 4.1206  |
| 2      | When the relative speed between the boat and the person is constant, the smaller the mass of the boat, the greater the speed at which it leaves the riverbank, and the harder it is for the person to jump ashore. The larger the mass of the boat, the greater the speed at which the person jumps off the boat, the easier it is to jump ashore. | 4.1886  |
| 3      | Considering that the internal force is much greater than the resistance of the water surface, relative to the ground reference frame, the system composed of the boat and the person conserves momentum. Since the center of mass is stationary, the smaller the mass of the boat, the greater the speed at which it leaves the riverbank, and the harder it is for the person to jump ashore. The larger the mass of the boat, the greater the speed at which the person jumps off the boat, the easier it is to jump ashore. | 4.7093  |
| 4      | The boat and the person can be regarded as two blocks connected by a spring. Considering that the internal force is much greater than the resistance of the water surface, relative to the ground reference frame, the system composed of the boat and the person conserves momentum, and mechanical energy is also conserved. In this way, the relative speed between the boat and the person is a constant value, which is independent of the choice of the inertial system. Since the center of mass is stationary, the smaller the mass of the boat, the greater the speed at which it leaves the riverbank, and the harder it is for the person to jump ashore. The larger the mass of the boat, the greater the speed at which the person jumps off the boat, the easier it is to jump ashore. | 5.2426  |
